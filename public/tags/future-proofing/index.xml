      <description>Consensus Algorithm We have a new member on team focused on the consensus algorithm. His work has been great and we are making a lot of progress. We now have a discrete event simulator in Python and have tested several candidate consensus algorithms on real world social graphs from the wikimedia admin dataset. Failure modes such as collusion, or nodes timing out have been implemented and tested.
The naive consensus algorithm, converged quickly enough for 15 second blocks.</description>
