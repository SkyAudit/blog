      <description>Thoughts on Marketing and Speculation: Skycoin marketing is highly targeted at influence groups and communities who need to know about Skycoin. The objective of Skycoin marketing is to build out the community and build awareness. Skycoin is not doing broad marketing aimed at public to &amp;ldquo;pump&amp;rdquo; prices to unsustainable levels. Skycoin will not be paying Lady Gaga to make a Skycoin music video.
Marketing tactics designed to cause bubbles and bursts are great for speculators, day trading and people organizing the pumps, but conflict with Skycoin&amp;rsquo;s objective of low volatility and stable price levels.</description>
