# Thoughts on Marketing and Speculation:

Skycoin marketing is highly targeted at influence groups and communities who need to know about Skycoin. The objective of Skycoin marketing is to build out the community and build awareness. Skycoin is not doing broad marketing aimed at public to "pump" prices to unsustainable levels.  Skycoin will not be paying Lady Gaga to make a Skycoin music video.

Marketing tactics designed to cause bubbles and bursts are great for speculators, day trading and people organizing the pumps, but conflict with Skycoin's objective of low volatility and stable price levels. Anyone expecting the Skycoin Lady Gaga music video pump should put their money in other coins.

## Our Principles:
1)  Skycoin is not a financial instrument or a get rich quick coin
2)  Skycoin is not about the money. Don't buy Skycoin for financial reasons.
3) Skycoin does not care if you only make 30x returns instead of 6000x returns. Skycoin is focused on delivering a working product.
4) If you want 6000x returns, buy Dogecoin. Great coin. Many riches.
5)  Buy Skycoin because you support the objectives of the project and want to be part of the community
6) All coins with a growing community will increase in value, but financial speculation does not create the community.

**Satoshi never intended for Bitcoin to be about the price.**

Also,
1. Skycoin development is being funded by the founders, not from the ICO
2. The ICO is a small initial distribution to the community and supporters
3. Speculators dont add anything to the project. Skycoin needs testers, developers, translators and other contributions.

For marketing, you dont want to know. We received message from fashion magazine writing story about Skycoin, Dogecoin and the Darknet. I have a feeling that the whole altcoin space is going to go insane soon.
