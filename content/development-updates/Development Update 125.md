###### Blockchain explorer almost done. Check github.
- github.com/skycoin/skycoin

###### New website
- skycoin.net

Exchange API and automated withdrawals and deposits has been in testing for a few months. Minor bugs fixed.

- We are working on "narrative" and explaining the differences between Skycoin and Bitcoin clearly and how the consensus process differs.
- Creating a movie to explain the project clearly
- Releasing the first applications that users can use and get coins.

The altcoin space is saturated with spam coins and we need to be very clear, concise and have a systematic marketing plan.

We might go back and just focus directly on the coin and the properties of the coin, instead of focusing on the ecosystem and software we are writing, because it is too complicated and long term to communicate easily.
