## Features:

## Ongoing Development:

- Wallet team is working on the JSON RPC
- Team is working on cryptographically secure messaging between wallets using Skycoin addresses. Skycoin addresses can act as email addresses and can send and receive messages securely. Working on "Identity Address" and "Wallet Address" RPCs.
