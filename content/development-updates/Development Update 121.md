Our technicals are done. I think we have fixed the last bugs. The wallet is getting polished up very nicely.

###### We need to start on marketing, applications, user community:

- We need to get blog and need to start getting content
- We need to start doing weekly content pushes.
- We need to pull in the market people
- We need to start doing sequential listings on the major exchanges
- We need to push out the first applications on the platform

So I think we are on track to shift focus to marketing soon. Definitely by the time the first two applications are running.
