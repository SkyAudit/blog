      <description>We fixed eighty wallet bugs. Look at commits on github.
The CLI is substantially upgraded and automated deposits and withdrawals are working now. Hundreds of changes and improves to the Skycoin CLI interface.
We upgraded to latest version of electron and the copy/paste issues are fixed.
32 bit windows builds should be ready in next release.
We are creating installers for windows and OSX, so that you can install skycoin like a native application.</description>

      <description>Summary: We are launching our own post blockchain social platform. Starting with an immutable object replication system, inspired by Urbit and IPFS. Which is designed for decentralized social networking and source independent networking.
We started this on friday and we almost have a decentralized text only version of 4chan working, five days later.

 Each object has a schema and is a struct (with basic set of atomic types)</description>

      <description>Coin Status: Dozens of bug fixes on the CLI and WebRPC interface. The OSX wallet directory bug is fixed now.
I have been using CLI interface a lot.
Meshnet: Three tasks left then we are onto info graphics and marketing. We do not have a user interface yet but back end will be working.
Marketing: We are trying to get full time person to manage the social media accounts, marketing and user community.</description>

      <description>Summary:  We need to fix the GUI on the dev branch. We need to debug the CLI (command line interface, for exchange)) We need to get the WebRPC (for exchanges)  We need to start building out the community.  Need a chat room Need a forum or BBS Need a messaging system  We need to get the three white papers done and the website:  Coin / Consensus Paper Meshnet Paper Aether Paper  Things we need:  We have to decide if we will float and do the first market internally or use a third party.</description>

      <description>Exchange: Exchange is done - https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin-exchange - bitcoin deposits - bitcoin withdrawls - skycoin deposits - skycoin withdrawls - order book
The Angular 2.0 gui for the client JSON API is being integrated right now.
This is not just an &amp;ldquo;exchange&amp;rdquo;, but - has &amp;ldquo;local&amp;rdquo; wallet (private keys and local wallets) and remote wallet (coins deposited in the exchange) - has a thin client, API, so that you can get unspent outputs and inject transactions - is multi-coin (the coin handling is pluggable, so that we can add new coins over time) - does not use HTTPS or even IP addresses.</description>

      <description>The first packet over the VPN, connected through the meshnet worked yesterday. - This is a major project milestone. - We have a multi-hop VPN client running over the Skycoin meshnet namespace. This is the first multi-hop VPN that I know of.
The port of the wallet from Angular 1.0 to Angular 2.0 is in progress and almost done. This means the design firm can start on the mobile wallet and multi-coin wallet.</description>

      <description>Meshnet: Version one meshnet is almost done
https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin/commit/f959d0875baf990e43ca3f045a9cba82d4d8f24a
This is the sixth or eighth design iteration, so it is very clean conceptually. I was simulating the meshnet packet passing algorithms with punch cards and paper and it works well. You could implement it on a punch card sorting machine and telegraph lines if you wanted to.
Exchange: Exchange is being refactored and fixed. We have a revolutionary exchange design, that simplifies the exchange, improves the security and enables easy support for multiple coins.</description>

For Skycoin: - finish exchange architecture (mostly boiler plate) - get meshnet routing algorithm working (there is some R&amp;amp;D here) - wrap a VPN frontend and then get it working on OSX and Windows
The angular 2.0 compilation/gulp setup is done and will use this as a pseudo terminal for now. I think this will be satisfactory for the interface.</description>

      <description>Cross Compilation: Cross compilation is now working flawlessly! We have builds for Windows, OSX, Linux, BSD, Plan9, Arm, NaCL. It is completely automated.
Deterministic Builds: Deterministic builds and pulling all the dependencies inside of the library will be done by about Go 1.6!
Deterministic builds, means that if two people compile the source, they will receive binary identical outputs. This means that the binaries cannot be back doored and can be verified.</description>

      <description>One of the three major project milestones is almost done. The crypto library port is nearly finished.
I am excited about checking this off list, because it is one of the most critical and time consuming things.
Development This is the fourth crypto library we have gone through. After first, we had to do testing and write fuzzing library and test suite, to make sure that the new library behaves as it should and do not not have strange edge cases.</description>

      <description>The exchange is in progress. As soon as the bitcoin/skycoin withdrawals/deposits are done, then it will take a few hours to get order book working.
I cannot wait for the order processing to be automated and to have some liquidity. Application developers will like this exchange and its API. It is very modular.
Windows Builds: The maintainer for the windows build slipped their fingers and actually deleted the virtual machine for doing the builds.</description>

      <description>Exchange Overview: This is a prototype for a next-generation exchange infrastructure.
http://github.com/skycoin/skycoin-exchange
This is very rough. Your username/login is a public key. Your identifier is a hash of your public key. You sign your messages to the exchange with your public key. This will be stored in a json file locally on the client.
//send this with every request // type MsgAuth struct { Address cipher.Address Hash cipher.SHA256 //hash of the JSON message Signature cipher.</description>

      <description>Skycoin is designed so that we can: Note: There are several scheduled changed that will change binary format and require blockchain resets:     Meshnet Update:        The hardware for meshnet mass adaption will be ready commercially within five years. It will only improve from there. What Skywire provides WISPs is two things For testing:        There will be a blockchain reset soon.</description>

      <description>This is over view of current development status and priorities
Consensus Consensus is being worked on. The earlier algorithms are being implemented, bench-marked. Then testing them against the newer algorithms, so we have comparison. This is currently in python. Will be moved to golang and integrated as soon as its ready.
This is not required for the distribution , because we can use central signing key until decentralized consensus is implemented.</description>

      <description>Consensus Algorithm We have a new member on team focused on the consensus algorithm. His work has been great and we are making a lot of progress. We now have a discrete event simulator in Python and have tested several candidate consensus algorithms on real world social graphs from the wikimedia admin dataset. Failure modes such as collusion, or nodes timing out have been implemented and tested.
The naive consensus algorithm, converged quickly enough for 15 second blocks.</description>

      <description>Summary: We have library now, for checking the unspent outputs for addresses. We are using obelisk tool kit and it is working well. The bitcoin blockchain synchronization has been running for a week now. It is on block 285,100 of block 323,354. It is 70 GB on disc and we dont know why. It has slowed down periodically, but has not stopped completely like bitcoind has. It is downloading a block a second.</description>

      <description>Summary: Massive changes. Everything is now in one repository. https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin
Changes skycoin/src/coin is the blockchain parser library skycoin/src/cipher is the Skycoin Standard Crytographic library skycoin/src/aether is the distributed application services library skycoin/src/skywire is the Skycoin Meshnet/Darknet switch skycoin/src/gui is the HTML local web wallet and infrastructure
 All of the cryptographic and hashing functions have been moved into a common library, that can be imported and used across different applications Skywire is now the meshnet/darknet instead of the services daemon.</description>

      <description>Summary: IPv6 support is working. We were having trouble before. Many of the residential routers appear as IPv4 but actually have IPv6 public IP addresses and are IPv4 NATs.
Configuring the IPv4 DNS settings on the local host does not override the IPv6 DNS server the router is using during 4to6 translation. We have no idea what is happening.
We are not sure if IPv4 and IPv6 hosts are able to operate on the same DHT network.</description>

      <description>Summary: We need to close out work on the coin so we can get onto the meshnet. We are trying to do too much: - Coin - Aether - Meshnet - Obelisk
Any one of these projects is an immense burden that requires a full development team.
The coin is done and we are just doing refactoring and cleanup of minor issues, but it is still requiring a lot of time.</description>
